# password-gen1
Updated password generator with save and paste option. Will generate a random password containing letters, numbers and special characters.

My motivation for this app was to create an easy to use password generator for the average user. Making it easy for them to create and save multiple random passwords. The main idea behind the app was to make the users experience with passwords easier and more secure.

Easy to install. Public repository able to be cloned to any individual machine.
